Make a contest! You can do it in 3 minutes at [jokerace.io](https://www.jokerace.io/) on any EVM chain that you want!

We support 45+ chains at this point, and if we don't have one you want please feel free to make a chain request [here](https://github.com/jk-labs-inc/jokerace/issues/new?assignees=&labels=chain&projects=&template=chain_request.md&title=chain%3A+) and we can get integrated!

Check out the 90+ chains and counting we already support [here](https://docs.jokerace.io/faq#which-chains-is-jokerace-live-on)!
