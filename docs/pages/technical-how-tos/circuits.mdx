# Circuits

We just shipped the ability for contest creators to direct where they want their earnings to go, which means that programmatic circuits can be built that supercharge engagement.

## Token Buybacks

You can point your contest's creator earnings to a contract that buys back your community's token every time someone submits or votes in your contest.

::::steps

### Deploy the buyback contract

Instructions to do so are on the repository [here](https://github.com/jk-labs-inc/auto-buy-contract).

### Route creator earnings to the buyback contract

In the monetization step of the create flow, set the "another wallet" field below to be the address of the deployed buyback contract.

### Create your contest!

Once your contest is live, all submitting and voting transactions on it will directly buy your token and send it to the player who is submitting or voting!
