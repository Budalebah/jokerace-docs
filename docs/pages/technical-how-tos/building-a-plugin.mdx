# Building a Plugin

JokeRace is entirely onchain, which means that anyone can build on top of us!

## Where to start
A good starting place for thinking about what it looks like to build something on top of us is to think about what could happen *as a result of* a contest.

For example:
- A winning NFT could be minted on a minting platform
- A winning grant could be funded through a grants platform
- A winning prompt could be fed into onchain AI
- A winning token or NFT could be bought with funds
- A winner could programmatically earn credentials ([Hats](https://twitter.com/hatsprotocol) has already built an implementation of this [here](https://github.com/Hats-Protocol/jokerace-eligibility)!)
